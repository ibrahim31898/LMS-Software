As a Professional web developer Modify above code. First make usre the Signup.jsx and Login.jsx look exactly as the images above and Home.jsx shows the Student list page with all the functionalities as shown in the image above. First make sure that i can Switch between Signup.jsx and Login.jsx page. second When I Enter the data in Signup form it stores the data in Firebase and Local storage and then it takes me to the Login.jsx page and when I Enter the data in Login form it matches the data I entered if it is correct then it takes me to the home.jsx page. Third when it takes me to the home.jsx page It shows me a student List as shown in image above in the form of a table. Make a seperate Studentregistration.jsx in which you will make a student registration form (in which there will be FirstName, LastName, Email, Password and a gender option in which i choose between boy and girl ) and when I enter the Data in the Studentregistration.jsx form it stores the data in the Home.jsx Student List and the Cloud Firestore Database and it displays the data (old or new) in the Student List in Home.jsx from Cloud Firestore Database.   Make a delete button in Student List in home.jsx so when i delete a student from the list it deletes the student in Cloud Firestore Database also.  Give full new code  and make sure it works perfectly with no errors.
